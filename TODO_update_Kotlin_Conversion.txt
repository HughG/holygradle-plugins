I need to bring the Kotlin_Conversion branch up to date with all the changes since then, not least the source
overrides work.  My hope is that it's enough to create a diff from the commit before the Kotlin_Conversion branch
started (9b75eaff9e23b96a79d80e736d4647968bc7bcdd), to the head of default (48a0dd8dac1d2f791086172bf552a48550e21883
just now), and then manually apply equivalent changes to the Kotlin branch.

TODO: Ensure DSL magic is applied by creating instances with project.extension or project.objects.newInstance, for
the following classes (because of their methods which take an Action argument).

- PathInfo (all)
- RepositoryHandler (delete)
- DefaultConfigurationSetType (makeSet)
- LinkHandler (from)
- PackageArtifactDescriptor (include, includeBuildScript, includeTextFile, includeSettingsFile, from)
- PackageArtifactTextFileCollector [and subclasses?] (includeBuildScript, includeTextFile, includeSettingsFile)
- ExecHelper?
