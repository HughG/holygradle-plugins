intrepid-plugin/src/main/groovy/holygradle/publishing/DefaultPublishPackagesExtension.groovy
* DONE: TODOs
* DONE: Make creation of default publication an option, defaulting to true.
* DONE: Option to always expose private configurations.

intrepid-plugin/src/main/groovy/holygradle/unpacking/PackedDependenciesStateHandler.groovy
* DONE: Logging

* intrepid-plugin\src\test\groovy\holygradle\links\LinkTaskIntegrationTest.groovy
** Err ... not really sure why I changed this.  Maybe temporarily to investigate
some problem, or just to make it a more obviously made-up version?

* intrepid-plugin/src/test/groovy/holygradle/publishing/DefaultPublishPackagesExtensionIntegrationTest.groovy
** DONE: Extra logging / stacktrace.

No-init-script stuff

* C:\Users\hughg\Documents\dev\holy-gradle-plugins\custom-gradle-core-plugin\src\main\groovy\holygradle\custom_gradle\CustomGradleCorePlugin.groovy
** DONE, UNTESTED: getInitScriptLocation doesn't make sense any more, as it is.

* C:\Users\hughg\Documents\dev\holy-gradle-plugins\gw.bat
** DONE, UNTESTED: This has a hard-coded mention of "gradle-1.4-bin", but I'd rather have it version-independent.

* C:\Users\hughg\Documents\dev\holy-gradle-plugins\publish.gradle (based on changes to test.gradle)
** DONE: Make sure all code for publishing the custom dist, really and for test, is gone.

* C:\Users\hughg\Documents\dev\holy-gradle-plugins\wrapper-starter-kit\newWrapper\build.gradle
** DONE: Check that isSnapshotWrapperVersion is defined somewhere, and is defined to be "wrapperVersion.endsWith('SNAPSHOT-0')" or equivalent.

* DONE: Change DefaultPublishPackagesExtension so that it doesn't need to be given the PublishingExtension
directly, because accessing that extension freezes the publishing objects so they can't be changed, but people
need to be able to change them to, e.g., add description and licence info to the Ivy XML.


Gradle 2.14.1
=============

* TODO: See if I can upgrade jna version in custom-gradle-core-plugin.

* TODO: See if I can upgrade to be able to build with Java 1.8 (even if it's set to preserve compatibility with 1.7).

* TODO: Work out why IntelliJ thinks the buildSrc project should be getting Gradle 2.9 JARs, and change it to 2.14.1 somehow.
** I still don't know, but IntelliJ re-downloads 2.9 if I delete it.

* TODO: Look into deprecation warnings.
** TODO: Changing resolution strategy after a configuration is resolved -- we shouldn't be doing that anyway!

* DONE: Add a test (maybe integration) to make sure that a build script can use the "publishing {}" block itself -- to ensure
that intrepid has not already accessed the PublishinExtension as a property.

* TODO: See if I can make DefaultPublishPackagesExtension not depend on PackageArtifactHandler.  Then it could be useful
without the rest of intrepid.
