/**
 * This task puts the Hg master repo URL and working directory version/branch/tags into a property and text file, which
 * feed into the packaging tasks for all sub-projects, so all build outputs are stamped with info on where they came
 * from.
 *
 *   - JAR files put it in META-INF/MANIFEST/MF.
 *   - custom-gradle puts it in the init.d/holy-gradle-init.gradle.
 *   - credential-store puts it in the Windows file properties of the generated EXE.
 *
 * If you change the form or location of this info, please update not only this comment but also the wiki page at
 * https://bitbucket.org/nm2501/holy-gradle-plugins/wiki/Home.
