This project contains a copy of some files from the JNA platform library,
(which is published under the GPL 2.1, and so is compatible with the Holy
Gradle license, GPL 3.0) because the Holy Gradle at one point required a
version of this which was newer than the version included within Gradle.

This may no longer be true, now that we've upgraded to Gradle 4.x,
but I haven't checked.
