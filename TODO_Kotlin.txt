TODO: Do I actually need @Inject for nested handlers, or is that only if I want to get an ObjectFactory without having a

TODO: Generally improve Kotlin style.

TODO: If scripts use ExecHelper, it will need DSL magic applied somehow to allow Groovy Closures to be passed to actions.
Maybe make an extension called "execHelper"?  Or explicitly accept Groovy Closures?
