TODO: Error message about "abort: could not find web.cacerts: C:\temp\Mercurial251\cacert.pem".  May
mean that you're trying to access a Mercurial repo over HTTPS, and the server's certificate is not
ultimately signed by a public authority.  One way to solve this for Mercurial is to put a root
certificate in your Mercurial install folder; but the gloss:holygradle[] uses its own private copy
of Mercurial, which won't find that certificate.  Instead, use hostfingerprints, or get a proper
cert for your server.  [TODO: add task to use local "hg.exe" from path, instead of internal one,
as a per-user.]
