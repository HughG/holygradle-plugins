/*
	This project contains extracts from https://github.com/gradle/kotlin-dsl,
	which is published under the Apache License 2.0, and so is compatible with
	the Holy Gradle license, GPL 3.0.
	
	The contents are copied into this project because I can't find a clean way
	to access the version of the "gradle-script-kotlin" JAR which is bundled
	with whichever Gradle version the Holy Gradle is used with; and, in any
	case, that implementation is fairly unstable.  I only need a small subset
	of it, so copying it out makes sense.
